# METHODOLOGY

## TXN CARBON MVP

The dataset for Transactions was taken from the Polygonscan API.

#### TXN Carbon process of mapping a block to an emission.

This solution is an MVP and a work in progress. The formula is:  &#x20;

&#x20;    (Sum of Gas Fee of all transaction of MINER Y/ Total number of transactions of Miner Y) X (Total transaction of Miners X Average CO2 cost per transaction) = XX kg CO2 &#x20;

The walletâ€™s footprint is the sum of Gas consumed for transactions leaving your wallet, multiplied by a best-guess estimated emissions factor. The emissions factor was derived from the average CO2 cost of transactions on Polygon.



The formula has its limits and is still a work in progress. There are theoretical researches on Ethereum emission that could potentially be used to build a better model. Since Polygon is a proof of Stake model, the architecture of the system enables us to use the average CO2 per transaction on Polygon because other variables will have negligible effects.
