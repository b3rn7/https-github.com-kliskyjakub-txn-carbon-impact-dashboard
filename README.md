# TXN Carbon

One of the biggest pain in cryptoverse is the carbon cost generated by crypto in general. Txn Carbon enables you to connect your wallet to our crypto API to measure your carbon impact.

The project uses reliable public data sets to produce fair and unbias values. The transactional carbon values reflect an honest opinion about the carbon cost of each transaction. Those assumptions have limits but reflect the best guess we are able to make according to available public data sets.

The methodology is a work in progress. By looking specifically at each transaction, using public data sets from such as average carbon footprint per country, weighted hash rate per country, in order to measure the carbon impact per ton of CO2.
