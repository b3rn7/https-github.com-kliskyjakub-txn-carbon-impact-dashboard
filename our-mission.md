# OUR MISSION

A sustainable crypto environment is essential to ensure the future of a fair and equitable society. It is impossible to ignore the carbon cost of crypto and there should be a sustainable viable solution. The future of crypto needs to be carbon negative to offset the direct carbon impact of crypto and offset the negative impact of previous societal actions.

The guiding principle driving the Txn Carbon team are the following:

* Working in an agile manner to build a transparent, unbiased, optimal manner and to develop the best methodology to measure the emissions related to crypto transactions.
* Understanding that compared to other industries' large carbon footprint (often bigger than crypto's), does not absolve the crypto community from formulating a solution moving towards a carbon negative world.
* Every action must be motivated by creating an optimal and sustainable solution to measure the carbon impact of crypto wallets.
* Txn Carbon will rely on available peer-reviewed and public information, which will give a more accurate and transparent measurement, methodology and challenge us to automatically keep up to date.
* Being able to collect and analyze information in crypto is a challenge and when there are limitations and doubts, we will explain thoroughly why and how we got there.
* We are developing in-depth knowledge about the crypto space and mother nature to build the best tool to enable carbon offsetting.
* "Ever tried. Ever Failed. No Matter. Try Again. Fail Again. Fail Better." Beckett
